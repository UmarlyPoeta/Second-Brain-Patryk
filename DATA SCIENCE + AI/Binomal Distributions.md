When you left 16 hours ago, you worked on Random Numbers and Probability, chapter 2 of the course Introduction to Statistics in Python. Here is what you covered in your last lesson:

You learned about the binomial distribution, a fundamental concept in probability that models events with two possible outcomes, such as flipping a coin. Key points included:

- Understanding binary outcomes, which can be success/failure, win/loss, or heads/tails, and how these can be represented numerically (1 or 0).
- Using the `binom.rvs` function from `scipy.stats` to simulate random variables following a binomial distribution. This function requires specifying the number of trials (n), the probability of success (p), and the size, which determines how many times the experiment is run.
- The difference between simulating a single trial multiple times and multiple trials in one go was illustrated with coin flips.
- Adjusting the probability of success (p) to model biased outcomes, like a weighted coin, and observing how it affects the results.
- Calculating probabilities with the binomial distribution using `binom.pmf` for the probability of a specific number of successes, and `binom.cdf` for the probability of up to a certain number of successes.
- The expected value of a binomial distribution, which is the average number of successes over many trials, can be calculated with `n * p`.

For example, to calculate the expected number of sales Amir will win each week with different win rates, you used the formula for the expected value in a binomial distribution:

```
# Expected number won with 30% win rate
won_30pct = 3 * 0.3
print(won_30pct)

# Expected number won with 25% win rate
won_25pct = 3 * 0.25
print(won_25pct)

# Expected number won with 35% win rate
won_35pct = 3 * 0.35
print(won_35pct)
```

This lesson emphasized the importance of understanding and applying the binomial distribution to model real-world scenarios with binary outcomes, enhancing your ability to analyze and predict the probability of events.

The goal of the next lesson is to learn how to analyze and interpret data that follows a normal distribution, using statistical tools and real-world applications.
