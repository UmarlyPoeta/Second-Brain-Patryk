When you left 13 hours ago, you worked on Data Cleaning and Imputation, chapter 2 of the course Exploratory Data Analysis in Python. Here is what you covered in your last lesson:

You learned about the importance of handling missing data in datasets to ensure accurate exploratory data analysis (EDA). Specifically, you discovered:

- **Why missing data matters**: Missing values can skew distributions and lead to incorrect conclusions. For example, omitting taller students in a height survey could falsely lower the average height.
- **Identifying missing data in pandas**: Using a dataset of data professionals, you practiced counting missing values with `.isna().sum()` in a pandas DataFrame, revealing insights into data completeness.
- **Strategies for addressing missing data**:
    - **Dropping observations**: If missing values constitute a small portion (â‰¤5%) of the dataset, it's reasonable to remove these observations.
    - **Imputation**: Replacing missing values with summary statistics (mean, median, mode) or more sophisticated methods based on subgroup characteristics. For instance, imputing salaries by experience level to maintain accuracy in salary distributions.

You applied these concepts through exercises, including:

- Calculating a threshold to identify columns for dropping or imputation in a dataset.
- Using Boolean indexing to filter columns for dropping and then applying `.dropna()` to clean the dataset.
- Imputing missing values by replacing them with the mode for categorical data and median for numerical data, tailored by relevant subgroups (e.g., experience level for salaries).

```
# Example code snippet from the lesson
salaries['Salary_USD'].fillna(salaries.groupby('Experience')['Salary_USD'].transform('median'), inplace=True)
```

This lesson equipped you with practical skills to improve dataset quality, making your data analysis more reliable and meaningful.

The goal of the next lesson is to learn how to clean and categorize textual data for easier analysis and visualization.
