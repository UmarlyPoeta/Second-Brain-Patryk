When you left 16 hours ago, you worked on More Distributions and the Central Limit Theorem, chapter 3 of the course Introduction to Statistics in Python. Here is what you covered in your last lesson:

You learned about the normal distribution, a fundamental concept in statistics due to its applicability in numerous real-world situations. The normal distribution, often visualized as a "bell curve," is defined by its mean and standard deviation, which dictate its center and spread, respectively. Key properties include its symmetry and the total area under the curve being 1. You explored how 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two, and 99.7% within three, known as the 68-95-99.7 rule.

Key points covered:

- The normal distribution's bell curve shape, mean, and standard deviation significantly influence its appearance and interpretation.
- Real-world data, like the heights of women from a health survey, often follow a normal distribution, allowing for practical applications such as calculating percentages within certain ranges using the `norm.cdf` function from `scipy.stats`.
- You practiced applying these concepts to Amir's sales data, exploring how to determine the distribution of sales amounts and calculate probabilities of various sales outcomes.
- Through exercises, you simulated future sales under new market conditions, adjusting the mean and standard deviation to reflect these changes and visualizing the results with a histogram.

```
# Simulate new sales amounts under changed market conditions
new_mean = 5000 * 1.2
new_sd = 2000 * 1.3
new_sales = norm.rvs(new_mean, new_sd, size=36)
plt.hist(new_sales)
plt.show()
```

This session equipped you with the tools to analyze and interpret data that follows a normal distribution, a critical skill in statistical analysis and data science.

The goal of the next lesson is to learn how to use the central limit theorem for estimating population parameters from sample data.
