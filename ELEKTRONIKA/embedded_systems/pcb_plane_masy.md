## ‚ö° Ground plane design

### Solid ground planes

#### Continuous copper pour
```
Best practices:

- Minimize plane splits
- Via stitching between layers
- Thermal relief dla through-hole components

Benefits:

```

#### Via stitching
```
Via stitching purposes:
- Connect ground planes on r√≥≈ºnych layers
- Reduce ground bounce
- Improve EMI performance
- Create uniform ground potential

Spacing guidelines:
- Œª/10 rule dla EMI: via spacing < wavelength/10
- Digital circuits: 5-20mm spacing
- High-speed signals: closer spacing (2-5mm)
- Clock circuits: very close spacing (1-2mm)
```

### Split ground planes

#### When ground splits are necessary
```
Applications requiring splits:
- Analog/digital isolation
- Different ground references
- Voltage domain separation
- Noise isolation requirements

Design considerations:
- Minimize split width
- Bridge with appropriate components
- Plan signal routing carefully
- Avoid crossing splits z high-speed signals
```

#### Bridging techniques
```
Connection methods:
- Ferrite beads: high frequency isolation
- Series resistance: current limiting
- Capacitors: AC coupling only
- Direct connection: common potential

Selection criteria:
- Frequency range of interest
- Current requirements
- Isolation needs
- EMI considerations
```

## üîÑ Current return paths

### Return current behavior

#### High frequency return currents
```
Skin effect:
- Current flows on conductor surface only
- Return current follows path of least impedance
- For high frequencies: follows closest ground

Proximity effect:
- Return current flows directly under signal trace
- Current density highest under signal
- Distance from signal determines return path width
```

#### Return path impedance
```
Loop inductance:
L = (Œº‚ÇÄ/2œÄ) √ó ln(2h/w) nH/mm

gdzie:
h = height to ground plane
w = trace width
Œº‚ÇÄ = free space permeability

Lower h = lower inductance = better performance
```

### Managing return paths

#### Continuous return paths
```
Design rules:
- Route signals over continuous ground
- Avoid plane splits gdzie possible
- Provide via stitching across gaps
- Plan layer transitions carefully

Layer change strategy:
Signal via + nearby ground via
Minimizes return path disruption
Reduces electromagnetic radiation
```

#### Via placement dla return currents
```
Return via guidelines:
- Place ground via near signal via
- Maximum distance: 3mm dla high-speed
- Both sides of differential pairs
- At layer transitions
- Near connector ground pins
```
