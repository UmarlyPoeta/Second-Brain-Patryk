# Amortized Analysis

> Method of analyzing algorithms that considers the average cost of operations over a sequence, rather than the worst-case cost of individual operations.

## üìñ Definition

Amortized analysis provides a way to analyze the average performance of operations in a data structure over a sequence of operations, even when individual operations might be expensive. It gives a more realistic view of algorithm performance than worst-case analysis alone.

## üéØ Analysis Methods

### 1. Aggregate Method
Calculate total cost of n operations and divide by n.

### 2. Accounting Method
Assign amortized costs to operations and maintain a credit system.

### 3. Potential Method
Use a potential function to measure the "stored energy" in the data structure.

## ‚ö° Key Concepts

- **Amortized Cost**: Average cost per operation over worst-case sequence
- **Credit System**: Operations can "pay" for future expensive operations
- **Worst-Case Sequence**: Sequence that maximizes total cost

## üéØ Common Examples

### Dynamic Array Resizing
- **Individual Operation**: O(n) for resize
- **Amortized Cost**: O(1) per append
- **Analysis**: Resize happens infrequently

### Binary Counter
- **Individual Operation**: O(k) bit flips
- **Amortized Cost**: O(1) per increment
- **Analysis**: Higher-order bits flip less frequently

### Splay Trees
- **Individual Operation**: O(n) for skewed tree
- **Amortized Cost**: O(log n) per access
- **Analysis**: Frequent items move closer to root

## üí° When to Use Amortized Analysis

‚úÖ **Use when:**
- Expensive operations are infrequent
- Operations naturally "pay" for future expensive operations
- Data structure maintains balance over time
- Interested in average performance over sequences

‚ùå **Not suitable when:**
- Need guaranteed per-operation bounds
- Single operation performance is critical
- Worst-case timing is important (real-time systems)

## üîß Analysis Techniques

### Aggregate Method
1. Find total cost of n operations
2. Divide by n to get amortized cost
3. Example: T(n) = cn, so amortized cost = c

### Accounting Method
1. Assign amortized cost to each operation
2. Ensure credit never goes negative
3. Expensive operations use accumulated credit

### Potential Method
1. Define potential function Œ¶(D)
2. Amortized cost = actual cost + ŒîŒ¶
3. Œ¶ increases when data structure becomes "expensive"

## üéØ Applications

1. **Data Structures**: Dynamic arrays, hash tables, splay trees
2. **Memory Management**: Garbage collection analysis
3. **Network Algorithms**: Link-state routing updates
4. **Database Systems**: B-tree maintenance operations
