# Knapsack Problem

> Classic optimization problem in dynamic programming where items with given weights and values must be selected to maximize value while staying within weight capacity.

## üìñ Definition

The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: given a set of items, each with a weight and value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given capacity and the total value is as large as possible.

## üéØ Problem Variants

### 1. 0/1 Knapsack (Bounded)
- Each item can be taken at most once
- Most common variant

### 2. Unbounded Knapsack
- Unlimited quantity of each item
- Can take same item multiple times

### 3. Bounded Knapsack
- Limited quantity for each item
- Generalization of 0/1 knapsack

## ‚ö° Time & Space Complexity

- **0/1 Knapsack**: O(n √ó W) time, O(n √ó W) space
- **Space Optimized**: O(W) space using rolling array
- **Unbounded**: O(n √ó W) time, O(W) space

Where n = number of items, W = knapsack capacity

## üêç Python Implementation

```python

    """0/1 Knapsack using 2D DP"""
    n = len(weights)
    
    # Create DP table
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Fill DP table
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(capacity + 1):
            # Don't take item i-1
            dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
