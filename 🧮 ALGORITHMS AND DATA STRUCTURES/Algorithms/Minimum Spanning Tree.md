# Minimum Spanning Tree

> See [[Kruskal Algorithm]] and [[Prim Algorithm]] for complete details about Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms.

A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a subset of edges in a connected, weighted graph that connects all vertices with the minimum total edge weight, without forming cycles.
